# üîê Dynamic OTP-Driven Secure Access System

## üìò Overview  
The **Dynamic OTP-Driven Secure Access System** is a secure, GSM-based access control solution built using the **LPC2148 microcontroller**. It enhances traditional authentication by introducing **real-time OTP (One-Time Password)** verification, ensuring restricted access based on time-sensitive authorization. Ideal for use in high-security areas, labs, or personal lockers, this project showcases the integration of embedded systems with wireless communication.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîë **Dual-Layer Authentication**  
  - First-level verification via password stored in EEPROM  
  - Second-level verification via OTP sent to registered mobile

- üì≤ **Real-Time OTP via GSM**  
  - OTP is generated on successful password entry  
  - Sent via **GSM module** using AT commands  
  - Valid only within a specific time window (RTC-controlled)

- ‚è±Ô∏è **RTC-Driven Time Validation**  
  - Uses on-chip **Real-Time Clock** to timestamp OTP generation  
  - Automatically invalidates OTP after time expires

- üîÑ **Interrupt-Based Password Update**  
  - External switch (interrupt-driven) allows secure password update  
  - New password is saved to EEPROM only after successful confirmation

- üîî **Access Feedback**  
  - LCD clearly displays system status: Waiting, OTP Sent, Access Granted, or Error  
  - Buzzer and LED can be optionally used for success/failure indicators

- üö´ **Robust Error Handling**  
  - GSM command acknowledgements checked before proceeding  
  - Invalid password, incorrect OTP, or timeout ‚Üí Access denied

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **System Idle**: Awaits user password input via keypad  
2. **Password Validation**:  
   - Compares input with EEPROM-stored password  
   - On success ‚Üí Proceeds to OTP generation  
3. **OTP Generation**:  
   - OTP generated and sent via GSM module  
   - OTP timestamp recorded using RTC  
4. **OTP Verification**:  
   - User must input OTP within valid time window  
   - Correct OTP ‚Üí Access granted (e.g., motor unlocked)  
   - Wrong or late OTP ‚Üí System resets  
5. **Password Change (Optional)**:  
   - Triggered via external interrupt  
   - Old password verification required  
   - New password stored in EEPROM after confirmation
