# DYNAMIC-OTP-DRIVEN-SECURE-ACCESS-SYSTEM-
Dynamic OTP Driven Secure Access System is a smart, time-sensitive access control mechanism that uses dual authentication-password and one-time password(OTP)-to ensure only authorized users can gain access. Built around the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller, this system integrates multiple embedded systems including GSM, I2C EEPROM, RTC and Interrupts.
